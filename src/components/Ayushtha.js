            User Trust: It's essential not to place blind trust in users'

            Designer Bias: Recognizing that designer bias is inevitable is
            crucial. There will always be design choices that seem optimal from
            a designer's perspective, but user feedback may reveal a different
            viewpoint. In such situations, it's important to take a step back,
            assess the validity of the user perspective, and make informed
            decisions that align with the project's goals.

          These insights underscore the importance of a user-centered approach
          in design and the need for designers to remain open to user feedback,
          even when it challenges their initial assumptions.

        <p className="bbt-second-para-2">
          I initiated this project in collaboration with my team during the
          DESIGNxSOCIAL hackathon organized by UMO, where we aimed to leverage
          our design expertise to address a real-time problem.
        </p>
        <p className="bbt-second-para-2">
          My significant contributions to this endeavor centered around
          conducting user interviews and meticulously analyzing the findings
          during the research phase. Additionally, I took a lead role in shaping
          the product purchase flow, ensuring a seamless and user-centric
          experience in the final design. This project not only honed my design
          skills but also reinforced my ability to bridge user insights with
          practical solutions.
